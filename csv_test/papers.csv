There were 147 patients with a definite diagnosis of LP by clinical and histological criteria, with 87 (59.2%) oral and 60 (40.8%) cutaneous specimens. Of these, 125 (85%) had positive DIF findings, with positive yields being significantly lower in oral (79.3%) than in cutaneous (93.3%) LP. Deposition of immunoreactants at the dermoepidermal junction (DEJ) was significantly greater in oral than in cutaneous LP, and fibrin deposition with shaggy pattern at the DEJ was also significantly greater in oral than in cutaneous LP. Deposition of immunoreactants at colloid bodies (CBs) with or without DEJ was significantly greater in cutaneous than in oral LP. IgM deposition at CBs was commonly detected in both groups. We propose that fibrin deposition with shaggy pattern at the DEJ is the best diagnostic indicator of oral LP.",2022-02-01,2022,1,Journal,47,2,389-393,389,393,0,False,ar,Article

This organism is ubiquitously present in the marine environment. Detection of V. parahaemolyticus in aquatic birds has been previously reported; however, the characterization of isolates of this bacterium recovered from these birds remains limited. The present study isolated and characterized V. parahaemolyticus from aquatic bird feces at the Bangpu Recreation Center (Samut Prakan province, Thailand) from 2016 to 2017, using multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and genome analysis. The results showed that V. parahaemolyticus was present in 34.9% (76/218) of the collected bird fecal samples. Among the ldh-positive V. parahaemolyticus isolates (n = 308), 1% (3/308) were positive for tdh, 1.3% (4/308) were positive for trh, and 0.3% (1/308) were positive for both tdh and trh. In turn, the MLST analysis revealed that 49 selected V. parahaemolyticus isolates resolved to 36 STs, 26 of which were novel (72.2%). Moreover, a total of 10 identified STs were identical to globally reported pathogenic strains (ST1309, ST1919, ST491, ST799, and ST2516) and environmental strains (ST1879, ST985, ST288, ST1925, and ST260). The genome analysis of isolates possessing tdh and/or trh (ST985, ST1923, ST1924, ST1929 and ST2516) demonstrated that the organization of the T3SS2a and T3SS2b genes in bird fecal isolates were almost identical to those of human clinical strains posing public health concerns of pathogen dissemination in the recreational area. The results of this study suggest that aquatic birds are natural reservoirs of new strains with high genetic diversity and are alternative sources of potentially pathogenic V. parahaemolyticus in the marine environment. IMPORTANCE To our knowledge, infection of foodborne bacterium V. parahamolyticus occurs via the consumption of undercooked seafood contaminated with pathogenic strains. Aquatic bird is a neglectable source that can transmit V. parahaemolyticus along coastal areas. This study reported the detection of potentially pathogenic V. parahamolyticus harboring virulence genes from aquatic bird feces at the recreational center situated near the Gulf of Thailand. These strains shared identical genetic profile to the clinical isolates that previously reported in many countries. Furthermore, the strains from aquatic birds showed extremely high genetic diversity. Our research pointed out that the aquatic bird is possibly involved in the evolution of novel strains of V. parahaemolyticus and play a role in dissimilation of the potentially pathogenic strains across geographical distance.",2022-06-01,2022,3,Journal,10,3,,,,1,False,ar,Article

Materials and methods: Thirty-four shoulders were dissected, and the coracoid processes were measured for their length, width, thickness, and coracohumeral distance. The association between measured values and body height was analyzed. Results: The mean dimension of the coracoid process was 13.1 ± 2.3 mm in width (range 9.6–19.3 mm), 23.7 ± 4.8 mm in length (range 14.4–33.3 mm), and 8.9 ± 1.4 mm in thickness (range 6.7–12.5 mm). The mean coracohumeral distance (CHD) was 9.3 ± 2.1 mm (range 5.6–14.1 mm). Pearson's correlation showed a positive correlation between body height and coracoid width (r = 0.36, p < 0.05) and coracoid thickness (r = 0.50, p < 0.01). Male cadavers showed significantly thicker (p < 0.001) and wider (p < 0.003) coracoids compared to those of females, but not length or CHD. The mean coracoid width for male was 14.6 ± 2.2 mm (range 11.1–19.3 mm) and female was 12.1 ± 1.8 mm (range 11.3–13.1 mm). The mean coracoid thickness for male was 9.8 ± 1.6 mm (range 6.7–12.5 mm) and female was 8.4 ± 1.0 mm (6.7–10.4 mm). Conclusions: The morphology of the coracoid is influenced by sex and body height. The coracoid thickness and width of the cadavers correlate with body height, but not length or CHD. These findings may help predict the size of the coracoid when surgery involves coracoid size determination.",2022-03-01,2022,5,Journal,26,,,,,0,False,ar,Article

Bacteriophages or phages, which are viruses that specifically kill bacteria, have been considered as alternative agents for the treatment of bacterial infections. Here, we discovered a lytic phage targeting P. aeruginosa, designated as JJ01, which was classified as a member of the Myoviridae family due to the presence of an icosahedral capsid and a contractile tail under TEM. Phage JJ01 requires at least 10 min for 90% of its particles to be adsorbed to the host cells and has a latent period of 30 min inside the host cell for its replication. JJ01 has a relatively large burst size, which releases approximately 109 particles/cell at the end of its lytic life cycle. The phage can withstand a wide range of pH values (3–10) and temperatures (4–60°C). Genome analysis showed that JJ01 possesses a complete genome of 66,346 base pairs with 55.7% of GC content, phylogenetically belonging to the genus Pbunavirus. Genome annotation further revealed that the genome encodes 92 open reading frames (ORFs) with 38 functionally predictable genes, and it contains neither tRNA nor toxin genes, such as drug-resistant or lysogenic-associated genes. Phage JJ01 is highly effective in suppressing bacterial cell growth for 12 h and eradicating biofilms established by the bacteria. Even though JJ01-resistant bacteria have emerged, the ability of phage resistance comes with the expense of the bacterial fitness cost. Some resistant strains were found to produce less biofilm and grow slower than the wild-type strain. Among the resistant isolates, the resistant strain W10 which notably loses its physiological fitness becomes eight times more susceptible to colistin and has its cell membrane compromised, compared to the wild type. Altogether, our data revealed the potential of phage JJ01 as a candidate for phage therapy against P. aeruginosa and further supports that even though the use of phages would subsequently lead to the emergence of phage-resistant bacteria, an evolutionary trade-off would make them more sensitive to antibiotics.",2022-10-06,2022,6,Journal,13,,,,,3,False,ar,Article

Our difference-in-differences estimates show that an exogenous decline in shareholder litigation risk results in a significant drop in ESG controversies. Specifically, ESG controversies fall by 40.85% in response to an exogenous reduction in litigation risk. When more insulated from shareholder litigation, managers prefer to live a quiet life, intentionally avoiding risky and contentious activities, which require more managerial time and effort. Additional analysis validates the results, including propensity score matching, entropy balancing, and Oster's (2019) testing of coefficient stability.

Objectives: To evaluate the interaction effect of temperature and total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) on the oxygen consumption rate (OCR) ofAsian seabass (Lates calcarifer) juveniles. Materials & Methods: The OCR of Asian seabass juveniles (mean weight ± SD of 8.09 ± 0.30 g and mean length ± SD of 7.25 ± 0.45 cm) were measured at three temperatures (29 °C, 32 °C and 36 °C) and three TAN levels (0 mg/L, 0.5 mg/L and 1.0 mg/L). The OC levels of fish in a respiratory chamber were measured, from which their OCRs were calculated. Results: This study was the first to show the interaction of temperature and TAN on the OCR of Asian seabass, which was highly significant (F = 7.449, df = 4, p = 0.001). The presence of TAN (0.5-1.0 mg/L) enhanced the adverse effect of rising temperature (≥ 32 °C), with the OCR affected. The developed polynomial equation was OCR = (0.0021 × Temperature × TAN) + 0.018, with a coefficient of determination of 0.935 that indicated a good fit to the data. Main finding: The interaction of temperature and TAN influenced the OCR of Asian seabass juveniles.

This study was a retrospective investigation between 2009 and 2018. Independent variables such as sex, age, pre-operative conditions, diagnosis, type of surgery, bleeding volume, surgery duration, and hospitalization were recorded. The data regarding orthognathic surgery adverse events and complications were evaluated and statistically analyzed with a significance level of p < 0.05. A total of 891 patients were included in this study (male 39.1%, female 60.9%) with a mean age of 26.4 ± 6.09 years. A neurosensory disturbance was found as immediate post-operative sequelae as 93.5%. The four most frequent complications had a relapse (6.4%), post-operative TMD (5.7%), unfavorable osteotomy (5.5%), and infection (4.9%), which seem to be more common in males. An average blood loss was 497 ± 371 ml and the average operative time was 401 ± 109.3 min. Complication rates were statistically affected by bleeding volume (p-value = 0.01), operative time (p-value = 0.03), and type of skeletal deformity (p-value = 0.01). Although numerous complications were recorded, no fatal complications were experienced. Bleeding time, operative time, and skeletal classification have significant influence on orthognathic surgery complications.

Using fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis, we discover multiple strategy combinations utilized by survivors to grow. Key findings suggest firms utilize ambidexterity, absorptive capacity, and agility to reconfigure their internal resources and reduce their reliance on the declining external network. This process increases self-reliance and returns higher rates of growth. These findings run counter to extant research which suggests increased network integration is a way for SMEs to overcome resource limitations. We attribute this difference to the context of firms operating in disrupted, declining markets. This study contributes to research on dynamic capability theory, warning against an over-reliance on external resources in a declining market and in doing so it provides practical paths for growth for SMEs facing disruption.",2022-01-01,2022,14,Journal,,,,,,5,False,ar,Article

Methods: A total of 183 individuals with chronic low back pain recruited from physical therapy clinics in Thailand completed the Thai versions of the 6-item University of Washington Concerns About Pain scale (T-UW-CAP6) and 6-item University of Washington Pain-Related Self-Efficacy scale (T-UW-PRSE6) at baseline and at 4 weeks follow-up. Perceived change in low back symptom was assessed at 4 weeks using a 7-point measure of Global Perceived Effect (GPE). Responsiveness of the T-UW-CAP6 and the T-UW-PRSE6 scale scores were evaluated by computing the effect sizes and standardized response means for change over time, and examining these as a function of the GPE ratings. Floor and ceiling effects were examined by evaluating the score distributions. Scale core MCIDs were estimated by computing a half a SD and SE of measurement statistics for each scale. Results: Responsiveness of the scales to pain treatment was supported by differences found in the mean change scores as a function of the treatment response categories. No significant floor or ceiling effects were found for either measure. Changes of 4.38 and 3.68 appeared to be the smallest change score perceived as clinical meaningful for the T-UW-CAP6 and T-UW-PRSE 6 scale scores, respectively.

Modern humans have inherited 1-6% of Neanderthal DNA as a result of interbreeding. These inherited Neanderthal genes have paradoxical influences, while some can provide protection to viral infections, some others are associated with autoimmune/auto-inflammatory diseases. Objective: We aim to investigate whether genetic variants with strong detrimental effects on the function of the immune system could have potentially contributed to the extinction of the Neanderthal population. Methods: We used the publically available genome information from an Altai Neanderthal and filtered for potentially damaging variants present in genes associated with inborn errors of immunity (IEI) and checked whether these variants were present in the genomes of the Denisovan, Vindija and Chagyrskaya Neanderthals. Results: We identified 24 homozygous variants and 15 heterozygous variants in IEI-related genes in the Altai. Neanderthal. Two homozygous variants in the UNC13D gene and one variant in the MOGS gene were present in all archaic genomes. Defects in the UNC13D gene are known to cause a severe and often fatal disease called. hemophagocytic lymphohistiocystosis (HLH). One of these variants p.(N943S) has been reported in patients with HLH. Variants in MOGS are associated with glycosylation defects in the immune system affecting the susceptibility for infections. Conclusion: Although the exact functional impact of these three variants needs further elucidation, we speculate that they could have resulted in an increased susceptibility to severe diseases and may have contributed to the extinction of Neanderthals after exposure to specific infections.",2022-01-01,2022,16,Journal,40,4,422-434,422,434,0,False,ar,Article

The am-TNTA catalyst was fabricated via a one-step synthesis, without heat treatment, by anodization of Titanium in Ethylene glycol-based electrolyte in a shorter anodizing time. The samples presented a TiO2 nanostructured array with a nanotubular diameter of 100 ± 10 nm, a wall thickness of 26 ± 5 nm, and length of 3.7 ± 0.3 μm, resulting in a specific surface of 0.75 m2 g. The am-TNTA presented prolonged chemical stability, a high exposed surface area, and a large number of surface traps that can reduce the recombination of the charge carriers. The am-TNTA showed promising photoactivity when tested in the CO2 reduction reaction with water under UV irradiation with a methane production rate of 14.0 μmol gcat−1 h−1 for a pure TiO2 material without any modification procedure. This enhanced photocatalytic activity can be explained in terms of surface defects of the amorphous structure, mainly OH groups that can act as electron traps for increasing the electron lifetime. The CO2 interacts directly with those traps, forming carbonate species, which favors the catalytic conversion to methane. The am-TNTA also exhibited a high stability during six reaction cycles. The photocatalytic activity, the significantly reduced time for synthesis, and high stability for continuous CH4 production make this nanomaterial a potential candidate for a sustainable CO2 reduction process and can be employed for other energy applications.",2022-02-01,2022,17,Journal,289,,,,,11,False,ar,Article

Spectrophotometric studies of complex formation, chemical structures and purity of the hydrogel sensor were carried out using TGA, NMR, TEM, and IR. The complexation study results indicated that this probe can selectively detect Au3+ via a metal ion chelation-induced ring-opening reaction, and then caused a remarkable colour change from colourless to pink and a strong fluorescence enhancement. Theoretical DFT calculation results suggested that the hydrogel sensor Arg-Rhoen formed stable complexes with Au3+ through a large number of cation–dipole interactions. Reusability has been established by repeatedly dipping and rinsing the hydrogel in aqueous Au3+ and EDTA in basic solutions.

In comparison to boiling, saturated steam under pressure in an autoclave caused more potential bioactive substances in beans to be released. Potential bioactive compound content and antioxidant activities of cooked beans and cooking water from autoclaving for 60 min and 10 min (A60 and A10) were higher than boiling for 60 min (B60). In vitro simulated gastrointestinal digestion revealed that the digestible fractions from A10 and A60 had higher antioxidant, ACE-I inhibitory, and DPP-IV inhibitory activities than B60 in the digestible fraction of adzuki beans paste. Cooking conditions and digestive enzyme cleavage influenced the exposure of specific antioxidant functional groups and hydrophobic groups. Catechin and vitexin were found to be the most abundant phenolics in all digestible fractions, whereas p-courmaric acid, sinapic acid, and syringic acid were found in digestible fractions from A10 but not B60 or A60. According to these findings, A10 could be recommended for cooking adzuki bean since it not only provides health-promoting actions of bean paste after in vitro digestion but it also reduces cooking time.",2022-07-01,2022,19,Journal,157,,,,,4,False,ar,Article

Identifying and dating sedimentary evidence deposited by such high energy events can assist in the planning and installation of suitable protection measurements. The Andaman Sea coast of Thailand is particularly vulnerable to such events as illustrated by the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami. Here, three shore-perpendicular transects and ten sediment cores along a beach ridge in the northern part of Lam Son National Park, Ranong Province, Andaman Sea coast are investigated with respect to high energy deposits. A multi-proxy analysis was conducted including stratigraphical correlations between cores, detailed description of physical characteristics, sedimentary structure, grain size, organic matter and carbonate content as well as identification of the remains of marine organisms. Optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was applied for determining the age of the sediments on this beach ridge plain. The stratigraphy and sediment characteristics, in particular composition, of the sands in the study area clearly allow us to distinguish between high energy deposits and normal beach sediments. Two high energy deposits were identified and attributed to result from the 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami as well as a past storm, which, based on OSL dating occurred more than 340 ± 20 years ago.",2022-07-10,2022,21,Journal,625,,82-95,82,95,4,True,ar,Article

When monotherapy of either primary treatment fails to control symptoms, combined medical therapy is an option. In this meta-analysis we assessed the additional effects of different medical combinations compared with primary treatments. Methods: Systematic searches on PubMed and EMBASE were updated on November 4, 2021. Randomized, controlled trials comparing the effects of combinations with monotherapy were included. There were 7 comparisons: (1) ATH-decongestant vs ATH; (2) ATH-leukotriene receptor antagonist (LTRA) vs ATH; (3) INCS-ATH vs INCS; (4) INCS-LTRA vs INCS; (5) INCS-decongestion vs INCS; (6) INCS-saline irrigation vs INCS; and (7) ATH-saline irrigation vs ATH. Data were pooled for meta-analysis. Outcomes were composite nasal symptom score, composite ocular symptom score, quality of life (QoL), and adverse events. Results: Fifty-three studies were included. Compared with ATH alone, the ATH-decongestant combination improved composite nasal symptoms; ATH-LTRA improved nasal symptoms in patients with perennial AR; and ATH-nasal saline improved both symptoms and QoL. Compared with INCS alone, the INCS-intranasal ATH combination improved nasal symptoms, ocular symptoms, and QoL; INCS-LTRA improved ocular symptoms but not nasal symptoms; and INCS-nasal saline improved QoL but not symptoms. There were no additional effects observed from adding oral ATH or topical decongestant to INCS. Conclusion: After ATH monotherapy fails to control symptoms, addition of decongestant, saline, or LTRA can improve the outcomes. When INCS monotherapy is ineffective, addition of intranasal ATH can improve nasal symptoms; LTRA can improve ocular symptoms, and saline irrigation can improve QoL.",2022-12-01,2022,22,Journal,12,12,1480-1502,1480,1502,3,False,ar,Article

Nowadays, only direct per-oral cholangioscopy (DPOC) and digital single-operator cholangioscopy (DS) are performed in daily practice. With better image resolution, POC is increasingly used as diagnostic tools in patients with suspected malignant biliary stricture (MBS). We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic yield of digital/video cholangioscopes for the diagnosis of MBS. Methods: A systematic search was performed in MEDLINE, Embase, and ISI Web of Knowledge databases until April 2020, to identify randomized controlled trials and prospective studies using digital or video POC. The meta-analysis of diagnostic accuracy study was performed to calculate summary estimates of the primary outcomes, including pooled sensitivity, and specificity of POC to diagnose MBS using bivariate random-effects models. Tissue histopathology was used as the reference standard for MBS diagnosis. For benign stricture, negative tissue histopathology and at least 6 months clinical follow-up were required. Results: Thirteen original articles with 876 patients were identified. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity were 88 (95% CI 83–91) and 95 (95% CI 89–98), respectively. The area under the curve (AUROC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.92–0.96). Subgroup analysis showed that cholangioscopic image impression provided significantly higher sensitivity (93% (95% CI 88–96) vs 82% (95% CI 76–87); p = 0.007), but lower specificity 86% (95% CI 75–92) vs 98 (95% CI 95–99); p < 0.001) than the tissue diagnosis from cholangioscopic-guided biopsy. In addition, biopsy obtained from DPOC had significantly higher sensitivity than that of DS (92% (95% CI 81–97) vs 79% (95% CI 72–84); p = 0.004). Diagnostic performance under image-enhanced endoscopy was not significantly better from white light endoscopy. Conclusions: Digital/video POC has very high diagnostic performance to diagnose MBS.

This association seemingly threatened male hegemony and cultural authority. It led, therefore, to the portrayal of the woman reader as a female quixote who was prone to misreading and being misled by what she read. This representation became popular during the rise of the novel in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and the New Woman's emergence at the fin-de-siècle. Similar developments took place in Siam/Thailand where the birth of fiction, the advent of the woman reader, and the New Woman's rise roughly coincided in the late 1910s and early 1920s. By examining San Thewarak's novel Bandai haeng khwam rak [Stairways to Love] (1932), this paper demonstrates the trope of the female quixote's invocation to describe the emerging Thai (New) Woman reader and the threat that she embodied that had to be managed and controlled.",2022-05-07,2022,24,Journal,10,1,75-84,75,84,0,False,ar,Article

We also aimed to determine whether the correlations depend on age and obesity. Sixty-eight normal weight and 66 obese women participated in this study. After adjustment for age, energy expenditure, energy intake, and education level, the RTL of all participants was negatively correlated with absolute RMR (RMRAB) and serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) concentration, and positively correlated with maximum oxygen consumption ((Formula presented.)

In this paper, high-density polyethylene (HDPE) and brown salwood were tested in a custom-built laboratory-scale fixed-bed reactor to investigate the co-pyrolysis reaction at temperatures ranging from 500 to 650 °C, nitrogen flow rates ranging from 40 to 160 mL min−1, and HDPE-to-biomass ratios ranging from 0.1 to 0.9. The results revealed that the temperature mostly influenced the pyrolysis products, whereas increasing the temperature to 600 °C promoted pyrolysis oil production, reaching a yield of 35.10 ± 1.20 wt%. Further increasing the reaction temperature to 650 °C decreased the yield to 34.57 ± 0.49 wt% because secondary cracking reactions produce a noncondensable gas rich in hydrocarbons. Physicochemical analysis of the pyrolyzed organic phase revealed a gross calorific heating value of up to approximately 38.19 MJ kg−1. Additionally, co-pyrolysis of HDPE improved the production of furans, and acid derivatives were obtained in the aqueous fraction via the thermal conversion of hemicellulose and lignin; conversely, the obtained char exhibited a notably low surface area and few superficial micropores and was used to further develop activated carbon for use as a catalyst in the catalytic pyrolysis of waste materials.",2022-04-01,2022,26,Journal,25,,,,,8,False,ar,Article

It has been speculated that the presence of a high number of reticulocytes in newborns interferes with the diagnosis of G6PD deficiency since reticulocytes contain higher amounts of G6PD enzyme than mature erythrocytes. Therefore, the purposes of this study were to assess the effect of reticulocytosis in the determination of blood G6PD activity in Thai newborns by using a novel automated UV-based enzymatic assay and to validate the performance of this assay for the detection of G6PD deficiency in newborn samples. Methods: The levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity were measured in blood samples collected from 1,015 newborns. G6PD mutations were identified using TaqMan® SNP genotyping assay, PCR–restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR–RFLP), and direct sequencing. The correlation between the levels of reticulocytes and G6PD activity was examined. The performance of the automated method was compared with that of the fluorescent spot test (FST) and the standard quantitative assay. Results: The automated assay detected G6PD deficiency in 6.5% of the total newborn subjects compared to 5.3% and 6.1% by the FST and the standard method, respectively. The minor allele frequencies (MAFs) of G6PD ViangchanG871A, G6PD MahidolG487A, and G6PD UnionC1360T were 0.066, 0.005, and 0.005, respectively. The reticulocyte counts in newborns with G6PD deficiency were significantly higher than those in normal male newborns (p < 0.001). Compared with normal newborns after controlling for thalassemias and hemoglobinopathies, G6PD-deficient patients with the G6PD ViangchanG871A mutation exhibited elevated reticulocyte counts (5.82 ± 1.73%, p < 0.001). In a group of G6PD normal newborns, the percentage of reticulocytes was positively correlated with G6PD activity (r = 0.327, p < 0.001). However, there was no correlation between G6PD activity and the levels of reticulocytes in subjects with G6PD deficiency (r = -0.019, p = 0.881). The level of agreement in the detection of G6PD deficiency was 0.999, while the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC) curve demonstrated that the automated method had 98.4% sensitivity, 99.5% specificity, 92.4% positive predictive value (PPV), 99.9% negative predictive value (NPV), and 99.4% accuracy.

Herein, an inorganic colloidal electrolyte composed of lithium magnesium silicate and zinc sulfate (LMS+ZSO) is utilized to improve the reversibility of Zn plating/stripping behavior for high-performance ZIBs. As revealed by the experimental and theoretical results, LMS's superior adsorption capacity for water molecules modulates the Zn2+ solvation structure via converting the free water molecules into adsorbed water of LMS and weakening the electrostatic coupling of anions and cations, thus restraining the corrosion, hydrogen evolution reaction and by-products. Concomitantly, the LMS lowers the energy barrier of de-solvation process to promote the Zn2+ ions transfer kinetics and induce the homogeneous deposition, thus inhibiting the dendrites formation. Consequently, the cycling stability of symmetric battery and zinc-based full battery are significantly boosted with LMS+ZSO electrolyte.

Extreme adaptive optics systems, such as the Spectro-Polarimetric High-contrast Exoplanet REsearch facility (SPHERE), push forward the limits in high contrast and high resolution in direct imaging. The main objectives of these instruments are exoplanet detection and characterisation. Aims. We aim to increase the contrast limits to detect new satellites orbiting known asteroids. We use cutting-edge data reduction techniques and data processing algorithms that are essential to best analyse the raw data provided by the instruments and increase their performances. Doing so, the unequalled performances of SPHERE also make it a unique tool to resolve and study asteroids in the solar system, expanding the domain of its main science targets. Methods. We applied a newly developed data reduction pipeline for integral field spectrographs on archival SPHERE data of a resolved asteroid, (130) Elektra. It was coupled with a dedicated point spread function reconstruction algorithm to model the asteroid halo. Following the halo removal, the moon signal could be extracted more accurately. The moon positions were fitted at three epochs and were used to derive the orbital parameters via a genetic-based algorithm. Results. We announce the discovery of S/2014 (130) 2, a third moon orbiting (130) Elektra, making it the first quadruple asteroid ever found. It is identified in three different epochs, 9, 30, and 31 Dec. 2014, at a respective angular separation of 258 mas (333 km), 229 mas (327 km), and 319 mas (457 km). We estimate that this moon has a period of 0.679 ± 0.001 day and a semi-major axis of 344 ± 5 km, with an eccentricity of 0.33 ± 0.05 and an inclination of 38° ±19° compared to the primary rotation axis. With a relative magnitude to the primary of 10.5 ± 0.5, its size is estimated to be 1.6 ± 0.4 km. Conclusions. The orbital parameters of S/2014 (130) 2 are poorly constrained due to the unfavourable configurations of the available fragmentary data. Additional observations are needed to better estimate its orbit and to suggest a formation model.

Median follow-up was 168 weeks (IQR: 156–204); 15 (6%) participants were lost to follow-up and 9 (4%) died. 27/246 (11%), 26/246 (11%) and 13/92 (14%) of participants who started RAL, DRV/r and ETR, respectively, discontinued these drugs; only three due to adverse events. 87%, 86%, 83% and 80% of the participants had HIV-1 RNA ≤200 copies/ml at weeks 48, 96, 144 and 168 (95% CI at week 168: 74–85%), respectively. Mean increase from study entry in CD4 count at week 168 was 265 cells/mm3 (95% CI 247–283). Conclusions: Third-line regimens comprising of RAL, DRV/r and/or ETR were very well tolerated and had high rates of durable virologic suppression among PLWH in LMICs who were failing on second-line PI-based ART prior to the availability of dolutegravir.",2022-06-01,2022,37,Journal,25,6,,,,1,False,ar,Article

Methods: Content analysis was used to evaluate drug information attached to 3 drug categories of 30 drug samples, and simulated patient studies at 247 pharmacies of selected townships in Yangon region were performed. Descriptive statistics and independent t-test were used for data analysis. Key findings: Among 30 proxy drug products, more than 80% provided information in English language both on the carton boxes and on leaflets. About 86.7% of leaflets were intended only for healthcare professional uses and not understandable for lay consumers. The simulated patient study found that overall drug information provided by dispensers was limited as confirmed by information providing mean score of 4.25 ± 2.06 out of a total of 18 points. Many other important information items such as drug name, concomitant drugs use, common side effects and when to stop taking medicine were rarely provided. None of the simulated patients received carton box or leaflet.

Currently, it is one of the largest, open access, mobile Parkinson’s Disease studies. Data from seven modules with a total of 8,320 participants who provided the data of at least one task were released to the public researcher. The modules comprise demographics, MDS-UPDRS I–II, PDQ-8, memory, tapping, voice, and walking. Finger-tapping is one of the tasks that easy to perform and has been analyzed for the quantitative measurement of PD. Therefore, participants who performed both the tapping activity and MDS-UPDRS I–II rating scale were selected for our analysis. Note that the MDS-UPDRS mPower Survey only contains parts of the original scale and has not been clinimetrically tested for validity and reliability. We obtained a total of 1851 samples that contained the tapping activity and MDS-UPDRS I–II for the analysis. Nine features were selected to represent tapping activity. K-mean was applied as an unsupervised clustering algorithm in our study. For determining the number of clusters, the elbow method, Sihouette score, and Davies–Bouldin index, were employed as supporting evaluation metrics. Based on these metrics and expert opinion, we decide that three clusters were appropriate for our study. The statistical analysis found that the tapping features could separate participants into three severity groups. Each group has different characteristics and could represent different PD severity based on the MDS-UPDRS I–II and PDQ-8 scores. Currently, the severity assessment of a movement disorder is based on clinical observation. Therefore, it is highly dependant on the skills and experiences of the trained movement disorder specialist who performs the procedure. We believe that any additional methods that could potentially assist with quantitative assessment of disease severity, without the need for a clinical visit would be beneficial to both the healthcare professionals and patients.",2022-12-01,2022,39,Journal,12,1,,,,7,False,ar,Article

In this retrospective study, the secondary outcomes of those public health measures on containing other respiratory infections among the Thai population were investigated. Hospitalization data spanning from 2016 to 2021 of six respiratory infectious diseases, namely influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, scarlet fever, and tuberculosis (TB), were examined. First, the expected respiratory infectious cases where no public health measures are in place are estimated using the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average (SARIMA) model. Then the expected number of cases and the observed cases were compared. The results showed a significant drop in the incidence of respiratory infectious diseases by an average of 61%. The reduction in hospitalization is significant for influenza, measles, pertussis, pneumonia, and scarlet fever (p < 0.05), while insignificant for TB (p = 0.54). The notable decrease in the incidence of cases is ascribed to the implementation of public health measures that minimized the opportunity for spread of disease. This decline in cases following relaxation of pandemic countermeasure is contingent on its scope and nature, and it is proof that selective physical distancing, hand hygiene, and use of face masks in public places is a viable route for mitigating respiratory morbidities.",2022-07-01,2022,40,Journal,48,,,,,6,True,ar,Article

Cyclic GMP AMP synthase (cGAS) is a cytosolic DNA sensor that recognizes dsDNA and creates cGAMP to activate STING-mediated type I IFN production. The activation of STING induces lupus disease in Fcgr2b deficient mice through the differentiation of dendritic cells. In contrast, Cgas-deficient mice could be generated more autoantibody production and proteinuria in pristane-induced lupus (PIL). These data suggested that the other dsDNA sensors could be involved in lupus development mechanisms. Methods: This study aimed to identify the cGAS-mediated mechanisms contributing to lupus pathogenesis in PIL. The Cgas-deficient and WT mice were induced lupus disease with pristane and subsequently analyzed autoantibody, histopathology, and immunophenotypes. The lung tissues were analyzed with the expression profiles by RT-PCR and western blot. The bone marrow-derived macrophages were stimulated with inflammasome activators and observed pyroptosis. Results: The Cgas-/- mice developed more severe pulmonary hemorrhage and autoantibody production than WT mice. The activated dendritic cells, IFN-g-, and IL-17a-producing T helper cells, and infiltrated macrophages in the lung were detected in Cgas-/- mice higher than in WT mice. We observed an increase in expression of Aim2, Casp11, and Ifi16 in the lung and serum IL-1a but IL-1b in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice. The rise of Caspase-11 in the lung of pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggested noncanonical inflammasome activation. The activation of AIM2 and NLRP3 inflammasomes in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) enhanced the number of dead cells in Cgas-/- mice compared with WT mice. Activation of the inflammasome significantly induced pyroptosis in Cgas-/- BMDMs. The dsDNA level, but not mitochondrial DNA, increased dramatically in pristane-injected Cgas-/- mice suggesting the dsDNA could be a ligand activating inflammasomes. The cGAS agonist-induced BMDM activation in the Cgas-/- mice indicated that the activation of DNA sensors other than cGAS enhanced activated macrophages. Conclusion: These findings suggested that cGAS hampers the unusual noncanonical inflammasome activation through other DNA sensors.",2022-12-16,2022,42,Journal,13,,,,,0,False,ar,Article

We previously demonstrated that low-degree HTa exposure decreased FI earlier than activated physiological responses, and this effect was related to the median preoptic nucleus (MnPO) and arcuate nucleus (Arc) connection. The present study refines the condition of low-degree HTa exposure and focuses on the mechanism of Arc neural activation. We demonstrated in the first experiment that with the usual ambient temperature (Ta) at 23 °C, the low degree HTa condition is at a 7 °C temperature difference and with 90 min exposure. Rats exposed to this short-term low-degree HTa had significantly lower 1-h FI than those exposed to control Ta (CTa) without differences in rectal temperature and hematocrit. Under nonfeeding conditions, HTa could enhance c-Fos at the Arc without the activation of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons. Under feeding conditions, HTa could enhance both c-Fos and POMC at Arc. In addition, the number of c-Fos and POMC colocalizations in the HTa group was higher than that in the CTa group. Finally, intracerebral preinfusion with a subthreshold dose of the melanocortin antagonist SHU9119 reversed the effect of low-degree HTa exposure on FI. Therefore, we conclude that the effect of short-term low-degree HTa exposure on FI in rats is mediated in part by activation of POMC neurons at the Arc. The results partially support the hypothesis that Arc is a crucial hypothalamic nucleus for the effect of low-degree HTa exposure on FI.",2022-03-01,2022,43,Journal,245,,,,,1,False,ar,Article

The oxygen consumption rates and ammonia removal rates of bioflocs as the BFT system shifts from assimilation towards nitrification have rarely been reported. Thus, the performance of the BFT system with a filtration unit was evaluated. RESULTS: Preliminary work found that the optimal screen pore size and recirculating flow rate were 100 μm and 3000 L day−1, respectively. The BFT system with the filtration unit could maintain suspended solids in the fish tank below 50 mg-SS L−1 while retaining significantly higher suspended solids in the biofloc reactor (509 ± 44.6 mg-SS L−1). The daily starch addition at a C:N mass ratio of 10:1 in phase I (day 1–38) induced the biofloc formation that kept TAN and nitrite levels below 1.0 mg-N L−1. The fraction of inorganic nitrogen compounds increased from 2.5% in phase I to 27.6% in phase III (day 56–70). TAN removal rates increased from 3.0 mg-N g-SS−1 day−1 during phase I to 10.34 ± 0.392 mg-N g-SS−1 day−1 after complete nitrification occurred. Relatively constant oxygen consumption rates of the bioflocs (149.1 ± 9.53 mg- O2 g-SS−1 day−1) were observed for the entire experiment. CONCLUSION: The BFT system with a filtration unit was effective in controlling suspended solid and inorganic nitrogen concentrations. Nitrogen treatment pathway of BFT system was assimilation during startup period but gradually shifted to nitrification. Oxygen consumption rates of the bioflocs are relatively constant regardless of the pathways responsible for nitrogen treatment. © 2021 Society of Chemical Industry (SCI).",2022-04-01,2022,44,Journal,97,4,924-932,924,932,0,False,ar,Article

Also, the density and viscosity are the important properties for the design of absorption system. The correlations to predict these properties are developed. The objectives of this work are to apply the existing correlations and to examine the correlation comparison such as the Redlich-Kister equation, Wilson model and empirical polynomial correlation to predict these properties. The measured results of viscosity and density come from the previous study. The measurement data are used to determine the excess molar volumes and viscosity deviations, which are then correlated as a function of the mass fraction and temperature by using non-linear regression method. The temperature and concentration of this study are ranging from 293.15 to 323.15 K and 0.05 - 0.30 mass fraction, respectively. The results of this work show that, among these three correlations, the Redlich-Kister equation is the most appropriate model that best corresponded with the experimental results because it can provide the lowest average absolute deviation compared with the experimental results. This model yields percent deviations of 0.054 % for density and 0.350 % for viscosity.

An important feature is that there is no need for a mesh since the method works on arbitrary local groups within a set of particles. A major drawback of shape matching is the fact that it is geometrically motivated and not derived from physical principles which makes calibration difficult. The fact that the method does not conserve volume can yield visual artifacts, e.g. when a tire is compressed but does not bulge. In this paper we present a new meshless simulation method that is related to shape matching but derived from continuous constitutive models. Volume conservation and stiffness can be specified with physical parameters. Further, if the elements of a tetrahedral mesh are used as groups, our method perfectly reproduces FEM based simulations.",2022-12-01,2022,45,Journal,41,8,1-7,1,7,2,False,ar,Article

The search uses a data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1 collected by the CMS experiment at the CERN LHC. The search is motivated by models of supersymmetry that predict the production of neutralinos, the neutral partners of the electroweak gauge and Higgs bosons. The observed event yields in the signal regions are found to be consistent with the standard model background expectations. The results are interpreted using simplified models of supersymmetry. For the electroweak production of nearly mass-degenerate higgsinos, each of whose decay chains yields a neutralino (χ~10) that in turn decays to a massless goldstino and a Higgs boson, (χ~10) masses in the range 175 to 1025 GeV are excluded at 95% confidence level. For the strong production of gluino pairs decaying via a slightly lighter (χ~20) to H and a light (χ~10), gluino masses below 2330 GeV are excluded.

Objectives: To determine (a) the prevalence of tracheomalacia in children with the ‘knee’ pattern on spirometry, and (b) whether spirometry parameters and visual characteristics of the ‘knee’ can identify presence/absence or severity of tracheomalacia. Patients/methods: We reviewed the spirometry undertaken at Queensland Children's Hospital between 2016 and 2019 and retrieved spirometry with the ‘knee’ pattern in the flow-volume curves. Flexible bronchoscopy videos of these children were reviewed for tracheomalacia diagnosis and severity in a blinded manner. We also evaluated several ‘knee’ characteristics (onset of inflection, angle of inflection, a scoop before plateau, plateau progression), spirometry parameters and tracheomalacia severity. Results: Of the 78 children with the ‘knee’, 51 (65.4%) had tracheomalacia. Spirometry values were significantly lower in those with tracheomalacia, compared to those without (predicted FEV1 = 86.1% vs 99.9%, FVC = 95.1% vs 104%, FEF25–75% = 68.6% vs 89.6%, all p < 0.02). A scoop before plateau was significantly associated with tracheomalacia (66.7% vs 40.7%, p = 0.03). There was no significant difference in spirometry parameters or the ‘knee’ characteristics between children with mild versus moderate-to-severe tracheomalacia. Conclusion: Most but not all children with the ‘knee’ pattern have flexible bronchoscopy-defined tracheomalacia. Those with tracheomalacia had lower spirometry values and the presence of a scoop before plateau was the most characteristic feature.

We demonstrated feasibility of artificial intelligence (AI) to aid in the detection of focal liver lesions (FLLs) during ultrasound. An AI system for FLL detection in ultrasound videos was developed. Data in this study were prospectively collected at a university hospital. We applied a two-step training strategy for developing the AI system by using a large collection of ultrasound snapshot images and frames from full-length ultrasound videos. Detection performance of the AI system was evaluated and then compared to detection performance by 25 physicians including 16 non-radiologist physicians and 9 radiologists. Our dataset contained 446 videos (273 videos with 387 FLLs and 173 videos without FLLs) from 334 patients.

Four Mitragyna species, M. speciosa (Roxb.) Korth. (MS), M. rotundifolia (Roxb.) Kuntze (MR), M. diversifolia (Wall. ex G. Don) Havil. (MD), and M. hirsuta Havil. (MH), occur in Thailand. M. speciosa, commonly known as ‘Kratom’ in Thai, is the only narcotic species for which buying, selling, importing or possessing has been prohibited by law in Thailand and some other countries. Mitragynine and 7-hydroxymitragynine, the major psychoactive compounds, are important in the treatment of opioid withdrawal. However, this species is used in traditional medicine to relieve pain and inflammation. Consequently, a rapid and easy technique for differentiating M. speciosa from closely related species is needed for routine forensic analysis.

The air discharged from ventilation systems produces consistent and high-speed wind when benchmarked against natural wind. However, the limitations of conventional wind turbines are that they have negative impacts on the ventilation system and are inconvenient to install in many areas. The innovative shaftless horizontal axis wind turbine (SHWT) introduced in this article has been designed to close the gap between the wind source and the conventional wind turbines in this process. The concept design shows how it could be mounted next to sources of waste wind, requiring only a small space for installation. An open hole is provided to enable airflow to be discharged into the environment. This SHWT has high market potential for utilizing man-made wind to generate electricity from an alternative source which supports sustainable energy development. The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the concept design of a prototype SHWT used for energy recovery from the discharged air of a ventilation system. How the rotor and stator design of the SHWT optimize wind turbine performance and minimize the negative effects on the ventilation system efficiency are also addressed in this study. The performance of the SHWT is demonstrated in a lab-scale test using the type of propeller fan that is generally applied in many sectors in Thailand. The results showed that the SHWT was successful in generating electricity and produced minimal negative effects on the ventilation system's performance. The maximum power output of the prototype SHWT is 7.4 W at a rotational speed of 1644 rpm using eight sets of magnets and 5.1 m/s wind speed. The maximum wind turbine efficiency is 51%.

For the AdaBoost classification model, the sensitivity/specificity was 94.12%/100% and 63.63%/53.13% at gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively. For the bagged regression trees model, the sensitivity/specificity was 94.12%/91.89% and 61.18%/68.75% at gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively. The root mean square error (RMSE) of difference between predicted and measured GPR was found at 2.44 and 1.22 for gamma criteria of 2%/2 mm and 3%/2 mm, respectively. The promising result was found at tighter gamma criteria 2%/2 mm with 94.12% sensitivity (both bagged regression trees and AdaBoost classification model) and 100% specificity (AdaBoost classification model).",2022-07-01,2022,52,Journal,23,7,,,,5,False,ar,Article

This study revealed the complicated pattern of the arterial supply of the lower nose. Methods: The arterial pattern of the lower nose was studied in 40 cadavers using conventional dissections and translucent modified Sihler staining. Results: Two arterial rings were connected in a figure of eight. The upper ring (nasal arterial circle) consisted of the lateral nasal and the subalar arteries encircling the nasal tip and alae. The lower ring (arterial plexus of the upper lip) was more important because of the contribution of the facial and superior labial arteries. This specific feature had not been mentioned elsewhere.

Loop-mediated isothermal amplification (TB-LAMP) is a simple, rapid, and specific point-of-care molecular diagnostic test. However, evaluation of its performance remains limited in children. This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of Eiken TB-LAMP among children with presumed tuberculosis disease. Methods: Pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens were collected from children under 18 years with presumed TB. Each specimen was tested by using TB-LAMP, acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear microscopy, and one of the two molecular assays (polymerase chain reaction [PCR] or Xpert MTB/RIF). Sensitivity and specificity were estimated compared to mycobacterial culture as reference standard. Results: From January 2020 to January 2021, 75 participants with presumed TB were enrolled with median age of 7 years (IQR 2-12). Seventeen specimens from 16 (21.3%) children had bacteriologically confirmed TB: 10 pulmonary and 7 extrapulmonary specimens. Overall sensitivity and specificity of TB-LAMP was 76.5% (95% CI 50.1%-93.2%) and 100% (95% CI 94.3%-100%), respectively. It had significantly higher sensitivity than AFB (52.9%, 95% CI 27.8%-77.0%) and similar to other molecular assays; PCR 82.4% (95% CI 56.6%-96.2%), Xpert MTB/RIF 70.0% (95% CI 34.8%-93.3%). Sensitivity of TB-LAMP for pulmonary, lymph node tissue, and extrapulmonary fluid was 80% (95% CI 44.4%-97.5%), 100% (95% CI 39.8-100), and 33.3% (95% CI 0.8-90.6), respectively. TB-LAMP detected all smear-positive (N = 9) and 50% of smear-negative (N = 8) specimens. Conclusions: TB-LAMP had higher sensitivity than AFB microscopy and accuracy similar to other molecular assays in both pulmonary and extrapulmonary specimens.

However, current studies on the inhalation of d-borneol remain limited in terms of CNS, ANS and emotional states. This study aimed to investigate the effects of d-borneol inhalation on psychophysiological parameters among healthy participants. Twenty-four healthy participants were recruited for participation in trials. The current research determined the changes in the autonomic nervous system (ANS) through physiological parameters, central nervous system (CNS) through electroencephalography (EEG) recordings, and psychological parameters through emotional states. EEG recordings were conducted based on 10-20 systems, and EEG band power was calculated by Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). For data analysis, d-borneol was inhaled and compared with sweet almond oil as base oil. Paired t-test was employed to measure the oil inhalation. The findings indicated that d-borneol inhalation could cause effects on (1) ANS physiological parameters by significantly increasing systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate, (2) psychological parameters of emotional states by significantly increasing the mean scores for good, active, fresh, romantic feelings while considerably decreasing the mean scores for bad, stressed, frustrated, annoyed, and disgusted feelings, and (3) EEG parameters by significantly increasing the power of the beta waves in the left and right areas of the posterior brain. In summary, d-borneol caused significant changes in psychophysiological parameters, indicating the stimulating effects of d-borneol inhalation.

Biochemical characterization shows that optimal pH and temperature for catalysis are 6.0 and 50 °C, respectively. Man26HM7 displayed excellent surfactant stability by retaining 70% of initial activity in 1%(w/v) SDS, and more than 90% of initial activity in 1%(w/v) Triton X-100 and Tween 80. Results from amino acid sequence alignment and molecular modeling suggest residue 238 of β-mannanase as a hotspot of SDS-tolerance. Mutagenesis at the equivalent residue of another homolog, β-mannanase from Bacillus subtilis CAe24 (Man26CAe24), significantly enhanced the SDS stability of this enzyme. Comparative computational analysis, including molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation, were then performed to compute the binding free energy of SDS to Man26HM7, Man26CAe24, and variant enzymes. The results suggest that residue 238 of Man26HM7 is involved in SDS binding to the hydrophobic surface of β-mannanase.

As for supercapacitor electrodes, molybdenum nitrides show promising potential. Molybdenum nitrides, however, are mainly prepared as nanopowders via a chemical route and require binders for the manufacture of electrodes. Such electrodes can impair the performance of supercapacitors. Herein, binder-free chromium (Cr)-doped molybdenum nitride (Mo2N) TFEs having different Cr concentrations are prepared via a reactive co-sputtering technique. The Cr-doped Mo2N films prepared have a cubic phase structure of γ-Mo2N with a minor shift in the (111) plane. While un-doped Mo2N films exhibit a spherical morphology, Cr-doped Mo2N films demonstrate a clear pyramid-like surface morphology. The developed Cr-doped Mo2N films contain 0–7.9 at.% of Cr in Mo2N lattice. A supercapacitor using a Cr-doped Mo2N electrode having the highest concentration of Cr reveals maximum areal capacity of 2780 mC/cm2, which is much higher than that of an un-doped Mo2N electrode (110 mC/cm2). Furthermore, the Cr-doped Mo2N electrode demonstrates excellent cycling stability, achieving ~ 94.6% capacity retention for about 2000 cycles. The reactive co-sputtering proves to be a suitable technique for fabrication of binder-free TFEs for high-performance energy storage device applications.

Results from this study revealed for the first time that the integumentary system of this species consisted of three layers including epicuticle, exocuticle and endocuticle. The muscular system apparently contained only skeletal muscle along the body. In the urinary system, we observed well-developed Malpighian tubules, each of which was covered with the simple cuboidal epitheliums. These epitheliums also contained the secretory granules that were reacted positively with periodic acid Schiff (PAS). The digestive system of this species was composed of three distinct parts including foregut, midgut and hindgut. The respiratory system was composed of the respiratory organ, which was rarely found near the integument system. This organ was lined with a simple squamous epithelium. Two regions of nervous system, i.e., frontal ganglion connected to the eye structure and ventral nerve cord, were found. Each ganglion basically consisted of two layers, outer cortex and inner medullae. The outer cortex contained three types of cells, including neurosecretory cells, neuroglial cells and neurons. The cytoplasmic inclusion of neurosecretory cells contained secretory granules, which reacted positively with PAS, indicating the presence the glycoprotein. The neuroglia and neuron were also observed in the inner medullae layer. The female reproductive system (the ovarian structure, the reproductive tract and the accessory organ) of this gerrid species was seen under histological sections.

Over the past decades, numerous antineoplastic compounds have been discovered from natural resources such as medicinal plants and marine species as part of multiple drug discovery initiatives. Notably, several marine flora (e.g. Ascophyllum nodosum, Sargassum thunbergii) have been identified as a rich source for novel cytotoxic compounds of different chemical forms. Despite the availability of enormous chemically enhanced new resources, the anticancer potential of marine flora and fauna has received little attention. Interestingly, numerous marine-derived secondary metabolites (e.g., Cytarabine, Trabectedin) have exhibited anticancer effects in preclinical cancer models. Most of the anticancer drugs obtained from marine sources stimulated apoptotic signal transduction pathways in cancer cells, such as the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways. This review highlights the sources of different cytotoxic secondary metabolites obtained from marine bacteria, algae, fungi, invertebrates, and vertebrates.

This study confirms a negative relationship between family ownership and a firm’s value in Thailand. Nevertheless, it reveals that the association between family ownership and firm’s value becomes positive if the Thai listed firms have a high proportion of independent directors. Further evidence confirms that the separation of chairman–CEO duality roles can increase a firm’s value, but it cannot solely enhance the value in those firms with high family ownership.

However, little is understood about clinicians' perspectives of AI applications in medical fields including ophthalmology, particularly in light of recent regulatory guidelines. The aim for this study was to evaluate the perspectives of ophthalmologists regarding AI in 4 major eye conditions: diabetic retinopathy (DR), glaucoma, age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract. Methods: This was a multi-national survey of ophthalmologists between March 1st, 2020 to February 29th, 2021 disseminated via the major global ophthalmology societies. The survey was designed based on microsystem, mesosystem and macrosystem questions, and the software as a medical device (SaMD) regulatory framework chaired by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Factors associated with AI adoption for ophthalmology analyzed with multivariable logistic regression random forest machine learning. Results: One thousand one hundred seventy-six ophthalmologists from 70 countries participated with a response rate ranging from 78.8 to 85.8% per question. Ophthalmologists were more willing to use AI as clinical assistive tools (88.1%, n = 890/1,010) especially those with over 20 years' experience (OR 3.70, 95% CI: 1.10–12.5, p = 0.035), as compared to clinical decision support tools (78.8%, n = 796/1,010) or diagnostic tools (64.5%, n = 651). A majority of Ophthalmologists felt that AI is most relevant to DR (78.2%), followed by glaucoma (70.7%), AMD (66.8%), and cataract (51.4%) detection. Many participants were confident their roles will not be replaced (68.2%, n = 632/927), and felt COVID-19 catalyzed willingness to adopt AI (80.9%, n = 750/927). Common barriers to implementation include medical liability from errors (72.5%, n = 672/927) whereas enablers include improving access (94.5%, n = 876/927).

This study aims to propose a new strategy to improve levan-type fructooligosaccharide (L-FOS) production. The effect of ISC/ LSC -mixed reaction was elucidated on L-FOS production. The presence of ISC in the LSC reaction significantly leads to the higher production of L-FOSs as the main products. Furthermore, the different ratios between ISC and LSC affected the distribution of L-FOSs. A greater amount of ISC compared to LSC promoted the synthesis of short-chain L-FOSs. Conversely, when LSC was increased, the synthesis of longer-chain L-FOSs was enhanced. The addition of trisaccharide mixtures obtained from either a single ISC or LSC reaction could enhance L-FOSs synthesis in the LSC reaction. Analysis of these trisaccharides revealed that most species of the oligosaccharides were similar, with 1-kestose being the major one. The supplement of only 1-kestose in the LSC reaction showed similar results to those of the reaction in the presence of trisaccharide mixtures. Moreover, the results were supported by molecular dynamics simulations.

However, the molecular mechanisms of C3R on Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion remains unknown. This study aimed to identify C3R's mechanisms of action in pancreatic β-cells. Rat INS-1 cells were used to elucidate the effects of C3R on insulin secretion, intracellular Ca2+ signaling, and gene expression. The results showed that C3R at 60, 100, and 300 µM concentrations significantly increased insulin secretion via intracellular Ca2+ signaling. The exposure of cells with C3R concentrations up to 100 μM did not affect cell viability. Pretreatment of cells with nimodipine (voltage-dependent Ca2+ channel (VDCC) blocker), U73122 (PLC inhibitor), and 2-APB (IP3 receptor blocker) inhibited the intracellular Ca2+ signals by C3R. Interestingly, C3R increased intracellular Ca2+ signals and insulin secretion after depletion of endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ stores by thapsigargin. However, insulin secretion was abolished under extracellular Ca2+-free conditions. Moreover, C3R upregulated mRNA expression for Glut2 and Kir6.2 genes. These findings indicate that C3R stimulated insulin secretion by promoting Ca2+ influx via VDCCs and activating the PLC-IP3 pathway. C3R also upregulates the expression of genes necessary for glucose-induced insulin secretion. This is the first study describing the molecular mechanisms by which C3R stimulates Ca2+-dependent insulin secretion from pancreatic β-cells.

However, the impact of direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) on steatosis is less clear. This study was aimed at evaluating serial fibrosis and steatosis alterations in patients with HCV genotype 1, who achieved sustained virological response (SVR). We enrolled 55 HCV mono-infected and 28 HCV/HIV co-infected patients receiving elbasvir/grazoprevir from a clinical trial. Fibrosis and steatosis were assessed at baseline, follow-up week-24 (FUw24) and week-72 (FUw72) by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and proton density fat fraction (PDFF), respectively. Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3) rs738409, transmembrane six superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2) rs58542926 and membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain-containing 7 (MBOAT7) rs641738 polymorphisms were determined by allelic discrimination. Overall, mean MRE decreased significantly from baseline to FUw24 and FUw72. At FUw72, patients with baseline F2-F4 had higher rate of ≥30% MRE decline compared with individuals with baseline F0-F1 (30.2%vs.3.3%, P = 0.004). In multivariate analysis, significant fibrosis was associated with MRE reduction. The prevalence of steatosis (PDFF≥5.2%) at baseline was 21.7%. Compared to baseline, there were 17 (20.5%) patients with decreased PDFF values at FUw72 (<30%), while 23 (27.7%) patients had increased PDFF values (≥30%). Regarding the overall cohort, mean PDFF significantly increased from baseline to FUw72, and displayed positive correlation with body mass index (BMI) alteration. In multivariate analysis, the presence of diabetes, PNPLA3 CG+GG genotypes and increased BMI at FUw72 were significantly associated with progressive steatosis after SVR. Other genetic variants were not related to fibrosis and steatosis alteration. This study concluded that HCV eradication was associated with fibrosis improvement. However, progressive steatosis was observed in a proportion of patients, particularly among.",2022-06-01,2022,64,Journal,17,6 June,,,,3,False,ar,Article

Bricks being a major constituent in the construction industry, also hold a significant proportion of the construction waste generated annually. The reuse of this brick waste in new constructions is an optimal solution considering cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the problems related to the substandard peak stress and ultimate strain of concrete constructed with recycled brick aggregates (CRAs) limit its use in non-structural applications. The present study intends to improve the unsatisfactory mechanical characteristics of CRAs by utilizing low-cost glass fiber chopped strand mat (FCSM) sheets. The efficacy of FCSM sheets was assessed by wrapping them around CRA specimens constructed with different concrete strengths. A remarkable increase in the peak compressive stress and the ultimate strain of the CRA specimens were observed. For low, medium, and high strength CRAs, the ultimate strain improved by up to 320%, 308%, and 294%, respectively, as compared to the respective control specimens. Several existing analytical models were utilized to predict the peak compressive stress and ultimate strain of the CRAs strengthened using FCSM sheets. None of the considered models reproduced experimental results accurately. Therefore, equations were formulated using regression predicting the peak stress and ultimate strain of the CRAs confined with FCSM sheets. The predicted values were found to correlate well with the experimental values.",2022-11-01,2022,69,Journal,14,21,,,,1,False,ar,Article

Herein, we synthesized CdS with hollow sphere (CdS-HS) structure and combined it with CoN to form CoN/CdS-HS photocatalytic system. The particular hollow sphere structure and cocatalyst CoN in the CoN/CdS-HS system increase the utilization of visible light and promote the separation and transfer of photo-generated carriers for photocatalysts, which greatly improves photocatalytic performance of materials. The time‐resolved photoluminescence spectra shows that the carrier lifetime of 15%CoN/CdS-HS is 7.52 ns, which is much larger than that of CdS (4.26 ns). In addition, the hydrogen output of the optimized 15%CoN/CdS-HS is 4.57 times superior to that of pristine CdS-HS under the same conditions. The photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate of 15%CoN/CdS-HS reaches 58.80 mmol/g.h under visible light with an apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 23.53% at 405 nm monochromatic light.

An in-depth investigation into low ADE reporting by consumers and community pharmacists was undertaken to uncover interventions to improve reporting. Method: In-depth interviewing of the three parties; consumers, pharmacists and employees of the Pharmacovigilance Center in Thailand, was used to collect the data. They were interviewed about ADE reporting experiences and contributing factors and problems of ADE reporting. Thematic analysis was used to interpret the results. Result: The HPVC received few ADE reports from consumers. Most community pharmacists received ADE reports from consumers; however, the Pharmacovigilance Center received few ADE reports from community pharmacists. ADE reporting of community pharmacists and consumers were influenced by many factors which were categorized into four themes which were (1) “Cognition” (awareness, attitude and responsibility); (2) “Reporting process” (complication, competency, information deficiency, feedback, and resource); (3) “Inducer” (service orientation, acquaintanceship, motivation, severity level, regulatory and reward); and (4) “Obstacle” (doubt, belief and prosecution). Conclusion: Health professionals should motivate consumers to report ADEs. Building social responsibility and benefits and increasing knowledge of reporting process, channels, and system to both community pharmacists and consumers were recommended. Providing rewards and making community pharmacists feel comfortable to report ADEs by simplifying the ADE form and providing training, guidelines, and an ADR assessment tool can drive them to report ADEs.

Detergents that are composed of surfactants and appropriate additives can decrease the natural attraction forces between particles and surface, leading to effective particle removal. This work aims to investigate the influences of detergent pH and additives on the effectiveness in removing inorganic particles from Al2O3 and AlTiC substrates, which are commonly used materials in the electronics industry. In this study, we chose a model detergent comprised of an anionic surfactant, sodium dodecylbenzene sulfonate, and two additives, namely sodium acid pyrophosphate and ethanolamine. Talc particles were employed as a model inorganic contaminant. The effects of pH and ethanolamine concentration on the cleaning effectiveness of the model detergent were examined using optical microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The stability of talc suspension in detergent solution, which is related to the possibility of particle recontamination, was determined by zeta potential. Our results indicate that the pH of the detergent directly affects its cleaning efficiency, likely by increasing the electrostatic repulsion between the surface and the talc particles. Similarly, the increasing ethanolamine concentration elevates the pH of the detergent, leading to better cleaning performances on both Al2O3 and AlTiC substrates.",2022-01-01,2022,73,Conference Proceeding,66,,3185-3190,3185,3190,0,False,ar,Article

Hypothetically, a greater QRS area denotes higher dyssynchrony and indicates potential benefits from cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT). Previous studies suggest a positive correlation between QRS area and the degree of response to CRT, but its clinical use remains unclear. We performed a meta-analysis of the relationship between QRS area and survival benefit following CRT. Methods: We comprehensively searched the MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Cochrane databases from inception to August 2021. We included studies with prospective and retrospective cohort designs that reported QRS area before CRT and total mortality. Data from each study were analyzed using a random-effects model. The results were reported as a hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence intervals. Results: Five observational studies including 4931 patients were identified. The cut-off values between large and small QRS areas ranged from 102 to 116 μVs. Our analysis showed a larger QRS area was statistically associated with increased 5-year survival in patients implanted with CRT (HR pooled 0.48, 95% CI 0.46–0.51, I2 = 54%, p <.0001). Greater QRS area reduction (pre- and post-implantation) were associated with a lower total mortality rate (HR pooled 0.45, 95% CI 0.38–0.52, I2 = 0%, p <.0001). Conclusion: Larger pre-implantation QRS area was associated with increased survival after CRT. QRS area reduction following CRT implantation was also associated with lower mortality.

The oxygen evolution reaction is one of way to achieve unlimited energy from water but the low stability, high energy required to drive the reaction (overpotential), complicated and unscalable synthesis method of expensive catalysis restricts its real time implementation into modern society. Herein this report, we suggested Ru-tailored hydrous cobalt phosphate and its concentration effect as a dopant to improve the catalytic properties. Electrocatalytic properties were studied via linear sweep voltammetry, chrono-potentiometric studies at a 10 mA/cm2 for 20 h, electrochemical active surface area, turnover frequency, and Tafel slope. Cobalt phosphate showed the connected-nanorods morphology, which is further tunned by increasing Ru-doping concentration, achieving various features from agglomerated nanorods sensitized with uniform nanoparticles on the micro-flower shapes consisting of interconnected nanorods sensitized with nanoparticles. The good electrocatalytic OER performance of 5% Ru-doped hydrous cobalt phosphate was achieved, exhibiting low overpotential up to 310 mV (vs. RHE) at 10 mA/cm2 besides a small Tafel slope of 62 mV/dec in 1 M KOH. As well, stable O2 evolution for a period of 20 h was shown. DFT calculation reveals that the Ru can increase electrical conductivity and promote OER activity, observed from Bader charge analysis, electron density difference, and OER Gibbs free energy. The EIS plot, ECSA, and TOF estimation disclose that the increased electrical conductivity, the improved ECSA, and the high intrinsic activity are together responsible for the good OER activity for 5%Ru–CoPO.",2022-12-01,2022,76,Journal,26,,,,,1,False,ar,Article

In this talk we describe in detail a comprehensive assessment of JUNO’s potential for detecting 8B solar neutrinos via the neutrino-electron elastic scattering process. A reduced 2 MeV threshold for the recoil electron energy is achievable with optimized background reduction strategies. With ten years of data taking, about 60,000 signal and 30,000 background events are expected. This leads to a simultaneous measurement of sin2 θ12and Δm212 using reactor antineutrinos and solar neutrinos in the JUNO detector. This large sample will enable an examination of the distortion of the recoil electron spectrum that is dominated by the neutrino flavor transformation in the dense solar matter. If Δm212 = 4.8 × 10−5(7.5 × 10−5eV2), JUNO can provide evidence of neutrino oscillation in the Earth at approximately the 3σ (2σ) level by measuring the non-zero signal rate variation with respect to the solar zenith angle. Moreover, JUNO can simultaneously measure Δm212 using 8B solar neutrinos to a precision of 20% or better, depending on the central value, and to sub-percent precision using reactor antineutrinos.

We aim to investigate the success rate of indirect decompression by LLIF with proposed selection criteria and identify risk factors associated with indirect decompression failure, defined as persistent pain requiring revision with direct decompression. Methods: Data from 191 patients undergoing LLIF were retrospectively reviewed. All the following criteria must be fulfilled: (1) dynamic clinical symptoms (pain relief in supine position), (2) presence of reducible disc height (recovered disc height in supine position), (3) no profound weakness, and (4) no static stenosis. The success rate of indirect decompression with LLIF and results after at least 1 year of follow-up were collected. Preoperative, procedure-related, and postoperative factors were assessed for their relationship with failure. Results: Of 191 patients,13 patients (6.8%) required additional direct decompression due to persistent pain, giving a criteria success rate of 93.2%. Factors associated with indirect decompression failure included low bone mineral density (T-score < 2.1), low reducible disc height (<13%), low postoperative disc height (< 10 mm), high-grade cage subsidence, and use of plate fixation.

This study aimed to evaluate the benefit of SLOGD in selected patients predicted at high risk of recurrent bleeding. Methods: From a cohort of 939 patients with bleeding peptic ulcers who underwent endoscopic hemostasis, we derived a 9-point risk score (age > 60, Male, ulcer ≥ 2 cm in size, posterior bulbar or lesser curve gastric ulcer, Forrest I bleeding, haemoglobin < 8 g/dl) to predict recurrent bleeding. We then validated the score in another cohort of 1334 patients (AUROC 0.77). To test the hypothesis that SLOGD in high-risk patients would improve outcomes, we did a randomized controlled trial to compare scheduled SLOGD with observation alone in those predicted at high risk of rebleeding (a score of ≥ 5).

Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in COVID-19 patients who received EA therapy at the King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital, Bangkok, Thailand, between March 13 and April 17, 2020. Relevant clinical and laboratory data were collected by inpatient chart review. Results: Among 147 hospitalized COVID-19 patients, 6 patients received EA therapy. All of the 6 patients had severe COVID-19 infection with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Among these, 5 of them were mechanically ventilated and 4 had complications of secondary bacterial infection. The endotoxin activity assay (EAA) results of pre-EA therapy ranged from 0.47 to 2.79. The choices of EA therapy were at the discretion of attending physicians. One patient was treated with oXiris® along with continuous renal replacement therapy, and the others received polymyxin B hemoperfusion sessions. All patients have survived and were finally free from the mechanical ventilation as well as had improvement in PaO2/FiO2 ratio and decreased EAA level after EA therapy.

To overcome this, tetrahydrocurcumin-diglutaric acid (TDG), a novel water-soluble ester prodrug of THC, was synthesized and evaluated for its protective effects against ethanol-induced toxicity in liver cells. Methods: A simple esterification reaction was used to synthesize TDG. Physicochemical properties including water solubility, partition coefficient, chemical stability, and drug release were evaluated. The in vitro protective effects of TDG against ethanol-induced toxicity in HepG2 cells were evaluated on cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation, oxidative stress, and apoptosis using MTT, DCFH-DA, antioxidant enzyme activity, and caspase activity assays, respectively. Results: TDG was successfully synthesized in good yield, and its chemical structure was confirmed via FT-IR, NMR, and high-resolution mass spectra. The solubility of TDG was greater than that of THC in phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) and able to release THC into the plasma. TDG exhibited protective effects by increasing cell viability compared with THC. Further studies on the hepatoprotective mechanisms revealed that TDG significantly reduced intracellular ROS compared with THC by restoring the antioxidant system (catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione levels). Moreover, TDG and THC inhibited apoptosis by modulating the activation of caspase-3 and -9.

The aim of this study is to elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the rhOPN-induced osteogenic differentiation of human PDL cells. Methods: Full length rhOPN (FL-OPN) and three constructs of OPN containing integrin binding domain (N142), calcium binding domain (C122) and mutated calcium-binding domain (C122δ) were generated from N. benthamiana. Human PDL cells were isolated from extracted third molars and cultured on FL-OPN, N142, C122, or C122δ-coated surfaces. Real-time PCR and Western blot analyses were used to determine mRNA and protein expression. In vitro calcification was determined by Alizarin red staining. A chemical inhibitor and RNAi silencing were used to elucidate signaling pathways. In silico analyses were performed to predict the protein-protein interaction. In vivo analysis was performed using a rat calvaria defect model. Results: Human PDL cells seeded on FL-OPN and C122-coated surfaces significantly increased both mRNA and protein expression of osterix (OSX) and enhanced in vitro calcification. Soluble FL-OPN as well as a surface coated with N142 did not affect OSX expression. Inhibition of activin receptor-like kinase (ALK-1) abolished the induction of osterix expression. In silico analysis suggested a possible interaction between the calcium binding domain (CaBD) of OPN and ALK-1 receptor. C122, but not C122δ coated surfaces, induced the expression of p-Smad-1 and this induction was inhibited by an ALK-1 inhibitor and RNAi against ALK-1. In vivo data showed that 3D porous scaffold containing C-122 enhanced new bone formation as compared to scaffold alone. Conclusion: The results suggest that next to full length OPN, the CaBD of OPN, if coated to a surface, induces osteogenic differentiation via interaction with ALK-1 receptor.",2022-02-01,2022,82,Journal,93,2,e13-e23,e13,e23,4,False,ar,Article

This study aimed to develop and validate a clustered regu-larly-interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated protein 12a (CRISPR/Cas12a) platform combined with isothermal amplification to detect leptospires from extracted patient DNA samples. Methodology/Principal findings A Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)-CRISPR/Cas12a-fluorescence assay was designed to detect the lipL32 gene of pathogenic Leptospira spp. The assays demonstrated a limit of detection (LOD) of 100 cells/mL, with no cross-reactivity against several other acute febrile illnesses. The clinical performance of the assay was validated with DNA extracted from 110 clinical specimens and then compared to results from qPCR detection of Leptospira spp. The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a assay showed 85.2% sensitivity, 100% specific-ity, and 92.7% accuracy. The sensitivity increased on days 4–6 after the fever onset and decreased after day 7. The specificity was consistent for several days after the onset of fever. The overall performance of the RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a platform was better than the commercial rapid diagnostic test (RDT). We also developed a lateral flow detection assay (LFDA) combined with RPA-CRISPR/Cas12a to make the test more accessible and easier to interpret. The combined LFDA showed a similar LOD of 100 cells/mL and could correctly distinguish between known positive and negative clinical samples in a pilot study. Conclusions/Significance The RPA-CRISPR/Cas12 targeting the lipL32 gene demonstrated acceptable sensitivity and excellent specificity for detection of leptospires. This assay might be an appropriate test for acute leptospirosis screening in limited-resource settings.",2022-01-01,2022,84,Journal,16,1,,,,12,False,ar,Article

The extent to which intradialytic parenteral nutrition (IDPN) contributes to improve PEW status in HD patients intolerable to ONS remains unclear. Maintenance PEW HD patients being unable to tolerate ONS adverse effects, and having spontaneous energy and protein intake of ≥ 20 kcal/kg/day and ≥ 0.8 g/kg/day, respectively were randomly assigned 1:1 into IDPN and control groups. In IDPN group, most concentrated 3-in-1, fish-oil based parenteral nutrition was infused during HD for 3 months. The control group received intensive dietary counselling once weekly for 3 months. Both groups were then followed for additional 3 months after intervention. A total of 38 patients were randomized (mean age 67.6 years). After 3 months, serum albumin was significantly higher in the IDPN (n = 18) compared with control group (from 3.5 ± 0.3 to 3.8 ± 0.2 vs from 3.6 ± 0.3 to 3.5 ± 0.3 g/dL, respectively, p = 0.01). Spontaneous dietary intake (p = 0.04), body weight (p = 0.01), and malnutrition inflammation score (MIS, p = 0.01) were improved in the IDPN, but not in the control group. Muscle mass, strength, serum prealbumin, interleukin-6, high sensitivity-c reactive protein, and acylated ghrelin were not significantly different but leptin levels increased in the control group after 3 months (p = 0.03). At 6 months, serum albumin in the IDPN group was persistently higher than baseline (p = 0.04). Neither volume overload nor uncontrolled hyperglycemia was found throughout the study. In conclusion, a 3-month IDPN supplementation demonstrated a significant increase in serum albumin, body weight, spontaneous oral intake, and MIS; and appeared to be superior to continuing intensive dietary counselling among HD patients intolerable to ONS. The impacts of IDPN therapy on clinical outcomes may require larger scale with longer period of study.",2022-12-01,2022,39,Journal,12,1,,,,5,False,ar,Article

The hydrogel was prepared by γ-irradiation crosslinking of PAA solution incorporated with graphene oxide (GO) and cellulose nanofiber (CNF). With high water-sorption capacity and transparency, the hydrogel was suitable to accommodate coloring reagents and enzymes for colorimetric sensing of urea in sweat. The colorimetric sensor exhibited vivid color change towards the increase of urea concentration in a linear range of 40–80 mM covering a cut-off value (60 mM) for chronic kidney disease (CKD) indication. Furthermore, the hydrogel could be directly applied as a substrate for direct quantitation of urea in sweat by laser desorption ionization mass spectroscopy (LDI-MS). While CNF improved the mechanical properties of the hydrogel, GO played a key role in enhancing laser desorption ionization of urea in LDI-MS and increased the hydrogel functionalities. LDI-MS verified that GO/CNF/PAA hydrogel could act as a direct matrix for promoting urea ionization and these results corresponded well with the colorimetric sensor. Hence, this hydrogel patch might be a potential material to be applied in non-invasive and dual-detection of CKD in medical diagnosis.",2022-07-31,2022,85,Journal,213,,1037-1046,1037,1046,9,False,ar,Article

The measurement is based on data collected in proton-proton collisions at s = 13 TeV by the CMS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 137 fb−1. The analysis uses the angular correlation between the decay planes of τ leptons produced in Higgs boson decays. The effective mixing angle between CP-even and CP-odd τ Yukawa couplings is found to be −1 ± 19°, compared to an expected value of 0 ± 21° at the 68.3% confidence level. The data disfavour the pure CP-odd scenario at 3.0 standard deviations. The results are compatible with predictions for the standard model Higgs boson.

However, it is hampered by mercury contamination. The objectives of this study are to determine total mercury (T-Hg) levels in edible portions of commercial seafood available in Bangkok’s supermarkets, and to evaluate the potential risks from mercury through seafood consumption. Total 32 species, including 22 fish, 4 cephalopod and 6 shellfish, were purchased from super-markets. Fish samples were dissected in 3 parts comprised of flesh, gill and viscera. While, cephalopod and shellfish were separated for edible tissues. The samples were digested in hot acid and were determined using cold-vapor atomic absorption spectrometry technique. The results revealed that T-Hg contained in the fish flesh > cephalopod > shellfish. In addition, T-Hg was accumulated in flesh > viscera > gill. Statistical analysis suggested that T-Hg accumulated in flesh was related positively with species, feeding habit, and habitat (p < 0.05). For risk analysis, estimated daily intake (EDI) of flesh ranged from 0.01 to 0.42 µg kg-1 bodyweight d-1, the lowest and highest EDI values were in salmon and yellowfin tuna, respectively. Yellowfin tuna, narrow-barred Spanish mackerel, fourfinger threadfin, and silver sillago were the 4 species that having the EDI values of T-Hg higher than the FAO/WHO recommended provisional tolerable daily intake (PTDI) of 0.23 µg kg-1 bodyweight d-1. Thus, the frequent consumption of these seafood are not recommended. In addition, the daily consumption of seafood should not exceed the maximum safe daily intake (MSDC). The MSDC of seafood in this study ranged from 15.5 (yellowfin tuna) to 474 (salmon) g d-1.",2022-01-01,2022,86,Journal,44,1,126-139,126,139,1,False,ar,Article

King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital is one of Thailand's largest liver transplant centers and is responsible for many pediatric cases. AIM To report the experience with pediatric LT and evaluate outcomes of living-related vs deceased-donor grafts. METHODS This evaluation included children who underwent LT between August 2004 and November 2019. Data were retrospectively reviewed, including demographics, diagnoses, laboratory values of donors and recipients, the pediatric end-stage liver disease (PELD) or model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score, graft source, wait time, perioperative course, postoperative complications, and survival rates. Continuous data were reported using the median and interquartile range. The Mann-Whitney U-test was used to compare the wait time between the living-related and deceased-donor groups. The chi-square or Fisher's exact test were used to compare the frequencies of between-group complications. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. RESULTS Ninety-four operated pediatric liver transplant patients were identified (54% were females). The median age at transplantation was 1.2 (0.8-3.8) years. The median PELD and MELD scores were 20 (13-26.8) and 19.5 (15.8-26.3), respectively. Most grafts (81.9%) were obtained from living-related donors. The median wait time for the living donors was significantly shorter compared with the deceased donors at 1.6 (0.3-3.1) mo vs 11.2 (2.1-33.3) mo (P = 0.01). Most patients were diagnosed with biliary atresia (74.5%), and infection was the most common complication within 30 d posttransplantation (14.9%). Without a desensitization protocol, 9% of transplants were ABO-incompatible. Eight hepatitis B core antibodies (anti-HBc)-negative recipients received positive anti-HBc grafts without different observed complications. The overall survival rate was 93.6% and 90.3% at 1 and 5 years, respectively. No graft loss during follow-up was noted among survivors. CONCLUSION A significant number of pediatric LT cases were reported in Thailand. Based on relatively comparable outcomes, ABO-incompatible and HBc antibody-positive grafts may be considered in an organ shortage situation.",2022-01-01,2022,87,Journal,14,3,583-591,583,591,1,False,ar,Article

The four-month-old male rats were sham-operated or orchidectomized (ODX). The ODX rats were divided into four groups, and orally treated for 2 months with either 1 mL/d of distilled water or 100 mg/kg/d of PME; or subcutaneously injected with 1 mg/kg/d of DHT or 80 μg/kg/d of E2. The impairment of spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in the ODX rats was prevented by DHT, E2, and PME. Recovery of the orchidectomy-induced deterioration of the synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus of rats was ranked as E2 ≥ PME > DHT. Both DHT and PME mitigated the increased Tau3 and Tau4 mRNA levels, and Tau-5 and P-Tau Ser396 protein levels more than E2 (DHT ≥ PME > E2). Only DHT tended to decrease App mRNA expression level. In conclusion, DHT showed a stronger efficacy for mitigation of the impaired spatial learning behavior and memory capacity in androgen-deficient male rats compared to E2 and PME, and their mechanisms of action are slightly different.",2022-07-01,2022,88,Journal,143,,,,,2,False,ar,Article

Previous reports showed that global DNA hypomethylation was correlated with various types of cancer including cervical cancer. Methods: Long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE1) pyrosequencing and Enzyme linked-immunosorbent assay (ELISA) assays were used for detection of global DNA methylation. The ELISA results were compared to bisulfite LINE1 pyrosequencing assay. Results: Different cervical cancer cell lines (CaSki, SiHa, HeLa, ME180, MS751, C33A) showed low global methylation percentage when compared to normal white blood cells by ELISA assay (1.47%-5.09% vs 8.20%, respectively) and by LINE1 pyrosequencing (20%-45% vs 62%, respectively). Global DNA methylation levels in cervical cancer samples were lower than precancerous lesions (Normal-CIN3) by LINE1 pyrosequencing (mean, 48.8% vs 56.9%, respectively, p<0.05) and ELISA assay (mean, 3.03% vs 3.85%, respectively, p<0.05). Conclusion: Global DNA hypomethylation was predominantly found in cervical cancer samples detected by ELISA and LINE1 pyrosequencing assays and could be used as triage tests in cervical cancer screening. ELISA assay is a suitable method for detection of global DNA methylation in large population; however, it should be further evaluated in a large clinical samples in order to be used as screening method.",2022-01-01,2022,89,Journal,23,1,143-149,143,149,1,False,ar,Article
